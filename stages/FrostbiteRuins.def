 ;This is how much the camera will move vertically towards the

 ;Typically .2 for normal-sized backgrounds. You may need to pull this
 ;value up for taller backgrounds.

 ;Minimum vertical distance the highest player has to be from the floor,

yscale = .05

 ;This parameter lets you set the range over which the shadow is
 ;visible. The first value is the high level, and the second is
 ;the middle level. Both represent y-coordinates of the player.
 ;A shadow is invisible if the player is above the high level,
 ;and fully visible if below the middle level. The shadow is
 ;faded in between the two levels. This gives an effect of the
 ;shadow fading away as the player gets farther away from the

;x, y
;If this line is omitted, the default value of 0,0 will be assumed.
start = -622,-386
;These are the number of pixels the background moves for every single unit
;of camera movement, in the format
;x, y
;For the main background (eg. the floor the players stand on) you'll want
;to use a delta of 1,1. Things farther away should have a smaller delta,
;like 0.5 for example. Things near the camera should have a larget delta.
;If this line is omitted, the default value of 1,1 will be assumed.
delta = .5,.9

;Here is the transparency setting of the background.
;Valid values are:
;"none" for normal drawing
;"add" for colour addition (like a spotlight effect)
;"add1" for colour addition with background dimmed to 50% brightness
;"addalpha" for colour addition with control over alpha values (you need
; an "alpha" parameter if you use this)
;"sub" for colour subtraction (like a shadow effect)
;If this line is omitted, it's assumed that there will be no transparency.
trans = none

;of the source (sprite), and the second is the alpha of the destination
;(background). The values range from 0 to 256.
;alpha = 256,0

;Mask means whether or not to draw colour zero of a sprite.
;If you turn masking off, the background will take less CPU power to draw,
;so remember to turn it off on sprites that don't use it.
;If this line is omitted, it's assumed that there will be no masking.
mask = 0

;The format for tiling is x,y. For each of them, the value is:

;Make the window smaller if you only want to draw part of the background.
;You normally do not have to change this setting. Value values range from
