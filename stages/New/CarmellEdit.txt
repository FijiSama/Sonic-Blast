This stage was originally made by Synck, CharMR. The original version had some exposed void at the top and left of the stage. I fixed that by adding more to the top of the main sky sprite and adjusting the bound code. The big thing I did was I hunted down some more sprites to add more variety to the walkway and the building in the background was missing the side and the roof so I went and hunted down the missing sprites and fixed that up as well. I also added some zoom to the stage whereas it was permanently zoomed out before.-Carmell.
